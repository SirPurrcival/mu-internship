Demo code for the kernel method to calculate LFPs from the spikes
of a network of point neurons

This demo shows the code to calculate the local field potential
(LFP) generated by a network of point neurons.  The kernel method
calculates the LFP solely from the spikes of the neurons, and the
knowledge of their position in space.  This kernel method is 
explained in detail in the publication:

 Telenczuk, B., Telenczuk, M. and Destexhe, A.  A kernel-based method to 
 calculate local field potentials from networks of spiking neurons. 
 bioRxiv preprint:

The program reads the raster of spike times, plots it, and then
calculates the LFP, and plots it.  The example provided is Brunel's
model of gamma oscillations (the code reproduces Fig. 6 of the paper).

Two versions are available:

1) A version in the hoc language used by the NEURON simulation
environment.  This version was written by Alain Destexhe.

2) A version in python 3 language, which does the same as the hoc
version.  This version was written by Bartosz Telenczuk.

This demo is open-access, but please cite the original work if you
use it.
